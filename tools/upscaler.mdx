description: "Enhance resolution and detail up to 4×"

## Overview

Improve clarity and sharpness while preserving textures and edges. Ideal for social exports or print-ready assets.

<Note icon="info">
Upscaler is available only for the last image you generated in the current session. If you start a new generation, the previous image becomes inactive for upscaling. This temporary limitation will be lifted in an upcoming update.

## Workflow

- Generate an image (Text to Image or Image to Video still).
- Open Upscaler from the result panel. Only the most recent image is eligible.
- Choose 2× or 4×, set Detail and Artifact Reduction.
- Preview and compare side-by-side, then export.

## Best practices

- Use 2× for web/social; 4× for print or cropping.
- Lower Artifact Reduction for clean sources; higher for compressed or low-res inputs.
- Keep Face Restore off for non-portrait content to avoid over-smoothing.

## Known limitations

- Only the last generated image in the session is eligible for upscaling.
- Batch upscaling and historical asset selection are coming soon.
