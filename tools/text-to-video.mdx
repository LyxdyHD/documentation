description: "Generate videos from text prompts with control over motion and style"
---

## Overview

Create videos directly from a prompt. Control duration, frame rate, stabilization, and style for predictable results.

## Parameters

- `durationSeconds`: Default 8; recommended 4–15 depending on platform.
- `frameRate`: Default 24; recommended 24–30 for smooth motion.
- `stabilizationStrength`: Default 0.5; 0.3–0.7 reduces jitter while preserving dynamics.
- `styleIntensity`: Default 0.6; 0.4–0.8 balances realism vs stylization.
- `guidanceScale`: Default 7; 5–9 controls adherence to prompt.

## Workflow

- Write a clear prompt with subject, environment, camera, lighting, and motion.
- Set duration and frame rate; adjust stabilization and style intensity.
- Generate multiple takes; compare continuity, focus, and pacing.
- Export MP4/WebM at the desired aspect ratio; upscale if needed.

## Examples

- Prompt: "A futuristic space battle with laser beams and explosions, cinematic lighting, epic scale"
-  Settings: `durationSeconds=8`, `frameRate=24`, `stabilizationStrength=0.5`, `styleIntensity=0.7`
-  Output: fast-paced battle shots with bright laser streaks and dramatic explosions.

- Prompt: "Slow-motion ocean waves at sunset, warm color grading, gentle camera drift"
-  Settings: `durationSeconds=12`, `frameRate=24`, `stabilizationStrength=0.6`, `styleIntensity=0.5`
-  Output: smooth waves with orange-pink sky and subtle drift.

## Tips

- Include motion cues ("slow pan", "dynamic tracking", "steady cam") for camera behavior.
- Use negative prompts ("no text overlays", "no artifacts") to reduce unwanted elements.
- Save prompts and settings as presets for consistent branding.

      <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Prompt used">
        An 8-second, ultra-dynamic 2D animation sequence, rendered in a modern, high-budget anime style (similar to MAPPA or Ufotable).
        [VIDEO STYLE]: Masterpiece quality, 4K resolution. Fluid, high-framerate sakuga animation with dramatic, cinematic camera work. The visuals are defined by sharp line art, intense particle effects, and dynamic lighting that flickers and casts long, moving shadows.
        [SCENE & NARRATIVE]: A climactic, ceremonial dance in the moonlit, crumbling courtyard of a ruined gothic cathedral. Rain is lashing down in stylized, slashing strokes.
        [SEQUENCE OF EVENTS]:
        [0.0s - 2.0s]: The Invocation. Low-angle, ultra-wide shot; silver-haired protagonist rises and sweeps arms; cyan energy particles coalesce with rain.
        [2.0s - 4.0s]: The Crescendo. Crash-zoom to eyes; dutch angle spin; cyan particles explode outward as non-violent light shockwave revealing intricate stone carvings.
        [4.0s - 6.5s]: The Manifestation. 360° camera arc; hands together; cyan particles concentrate into luminous glyph or lotus forming and pulsing.
        [6.5s - 8.0s]: The Aftermath. Slow push-in to serene smile; creation floats between hands; rain softens; gentle cyan light on face; fade to black.

        Ultra-realistic cinematic video, rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with path-traced global illumination and a high-poly asset library.

        [SCENE & NARRATIVE]: Quiet discovery in a dusty corner of an old independent bookstore at golden hour.
        [SEQUENCE OF EVENTS]:
        [0.0s - 2.0s]: Medium tracking shot down narrow aisle; volumetric god rays; dust motes; peaceful searching.
        [2.0s - 5.0s]: Stops; slow push-in; focus rack to hand; traces embossed title; hyper-real leather texture and dust with displacement and roughness.
        [5.0s - 7.0s]: Close-up slightly below eyeline; pulls book; subtle genuine smile; key light catches peach fuzz and tiny faded scar; freeze on expression.
