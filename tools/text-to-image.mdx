## Overview

Create photorealistic or stylized images using carefully crafted prompts. Use lens, lighting, composition, and film stock cues for predictable results.

        An extreme macro close-up, a fleeting and intimate moment of quiet introspection captured in the mesmerizing universe of a single human eye. The subject is a beautiful young woman, her iris a complex tapestry of emerald and jade green, flecked with tiny, natural imperfections of amber and gold. The entire scene is illuminated by soft, diffused, overcast window light coming from the side, creating a single, large, rectangular catchlight that gives the eye a profound sense of life and reveals its watery, reflective surface. Hyper-realistic details are paramount: the delicate, branching red blood vessels are visible in the sclera, the pupil is slightly dilated, and individual, non-uniform eyelashes, some slightly clumped with residual mascara, frame the eye. The delicate, paper-thin skin of the eyelid shows faint, almost imperceptible creases, and the skin just at the corner of the frame reveals visible pores and fine peach fuzz. Within the cornea's sharp, convex reflection, a distorted, almost abstract view of a rain-streaked window pane is visible, grounding the scene in a quiet, pensive day. Shot on a 100mm macro lens at f/2.8, the depth of field is exceptionally shallow, with tack-sharp focus locked only on the very front surface of the iris and a few specific eyelashes, while the rest of the eye and surrounding features fall off into a creamy, soft blur. The image emulates the look of Kodak Portra 400 film, characterized by a heavy but fine-grained filmic texture and subtle chromatic aberration on the high-contrast edges of the catchlight.

      <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Prompt used">
        A candid moment of pure, uninhibited joy, capturing a conventionally attractive young caucasian woman in her early 20s. She is captured mid-twirl in a full-body, slightly low-angle shot, her head thrown back in an open-mouthed, joyful laugh that crinkles the corners of her eyes. She wears a flowing, sleeveless maxi dress made of a lightweight, slightly sheer lavender-purple linen fabric, its hem caught in the motion of her spin, creating a dynamic, flowing silhouette as she stands barefoot in a vast, wild meadow filled with tall, golden-brown grasses and scattered wildflowers. The entire scene is dramatically backlit by the low, warm, golden hour sun, which creates a brilliant, glowing rim light around her silhouette, catching individual strands of her hair and making the sheer fabric of her dress almost translucent. This harsh, direct light mercilessly reveals every detail of her natural skin texture—a slight sheen of sweat on her brow, visible pores on her cheeks, and the fine peach fuzz along her jawline catching the golden light. Shot as if on a full-frame DSLR with a vintage 85mm f/1.4 lens wide open, the image has tack-sharp focus on her laughing face, while the foreground and background grasses melt into a creamy, abstract bokeh. The image is defined by a massive, warm anamorphic lens flare cutting across the frame, a heavy but fine-grained filmic texture emulating Kodak Gold 200, and a saturated, warm color palette that perfectly captures the euphoric, golden moment.

      <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Prompt used">
        A moment of profound, weary boredom, captured in a 24-hour laundromat long after midnight. The subject is a young woman in her early 20s, of ambiguous East Asian or Hispanic descent, whose un-glamorous authenticity is the entire focus. She is slumped low in a hard, orange plastic laundromat chair, her legs propped up casually on the metal laundry cart in front of her, her gaze vacant as she stares blankly just past the camera. The scene is brutally lit by the sterile, flickering, greenish-white of overhead fluorescent tube lights, an unflattering, flat light that creates soft, sickly shadows under her eyes and jaw, and reveals hyper-realistic skin texture: an oily sheen on her forehead from the stuffy, un-airconditioned room, visible pores around her nose, a faint, almost-healed blemish on her temple, and slightly bloodshot eyes from fatigue. Her slightly greasy, unwashed dark hair is pulled into a messy, loose bun, with countless fine flyaway hairs catching the harsh light. She wears a worn, faded, and slightly-too-large band t-shirt (the graphic is cracked and illegible) and simple, grey marled cotton sweatpants. The environment is one of mundane neglect: a row of humming, off-white washing machines lines the wall behind her, one with a hand-written 'Out of Order' sign taped to it, and the cracked linoleum floor reflects the harsh glare, with scuff marks and a discarded lottery ticket visible. Shot as if on an early 2000s-era point-and-shoot digital camera, a direct on-camera flash has fired, creating a flat front light and a hard-edged shadow on the wall behind her. The image is defined by its characteristic low-resolution quality, heavy digital grain, visible sensor noise, and blown-out specular highlights on her shiny forehead, with a subtle purple chromatic aberration on the high-contrast edges and an orange date stamp in the bottom-right corner.

## Tips

- Use lens and aperture details (e.g., 85mm f/1.4) to control depth of field.
- Specify lighting (golden hour rim light, soft window light) for mood and realism.
- Add film stock cues (Kodak Portra 400, Gold 200) for color and grain character.
