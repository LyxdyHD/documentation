description: "Curated prompts and patterns to guide generation"

## How to write effective prompts

- Start with a clear subject (person, product, scene)
- Add environment and context (location, time of day, weather)
- Specify lighting (soft window light, golden hour rim light, fluorescent)
- Include camera details (lens, aperture) and composition (close-up, low angle)
- Choose style cues (film stock, color grading, grain)
- Add motion or depth cues (for videos) and negative prompts to avoid artifacts

### Template

- Subject + Environment + Lighting + Camera + Composition + Style + Details + Negative Prompts

Example:
Subject (portrait) in Environment (meadow at golden hour) with Lighting (strong backlight rim), Camera (85mm f/1.4, low angle), Composition (full-body twirl), Style (Kodak Gold 200), Details (warm anamorphic flare), Negative (no text overlays, no artifacts)

## Categories

- Nature: "Slow-motion ocean waves at sunset, warm color grading, gentle camera drift"
- City: "Neon-lit cyberpunk alley at night, rain, reflective puddles, steady cam"
- Sci‑fi: "Futuristic space battle with laser beams and explosions, cinematic lighting"
- Product: "Studio-lit product on matte background, soft shadow, subtle parallax"
- People: "Portrait in soft golden hour light, shallow depth of field, gentle pan"

## Negative prompts

- "no text overlays", "no artifacts", "no flicker", "no heavy compression"

## Patterns

- Subject + Environment + Lighting + Camera + Motion + Style
- Example: "Subject (retro car) in Environment (desert road) with Lighting (golden hour), Camera (steady tracking), Motion (slow pan), Style (film grain)"
